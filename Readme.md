## Helper functions for the book "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python"

This is the ``mglearn`` package used in the book, which you can also find in the
[accompanying repository](
https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python)

You don't need this repo, all the code is there:

This repository is a stand-alone package in case you really feel like you want to
install mglearn into your Python environment, for some reason or another. You can install it by running

    pip install mglearn

in your terminal, or by running

    !pip install mglearn

in Jupyter Notebook.

In particular, installing this package is a very easy way to add it to your Python search path.
Or you can just check out the notebooks from the repository above, and add the path to the
mglearn subfolder to your PYTHONPATH environment variable (or set it in your IDE).

The tests for this repository can be executed by running

    python setup.py test

in your terminal after you have cloned the repository.
